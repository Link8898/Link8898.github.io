            <h3>
                Hi, I’m Noah, and I’m a computer programmer.
                Originally, I was fascinated by the graphics and art within digital entertainment and the storylines
                for well designed games. My programming journey began online, leveraging just about every
                type of resource available, including community forums for problem solving and brainstorming.
                I am interested in a career as a professional software engineer and have been learning languages,
                specific applications and other supportive skills to code games in my free time. I began with
                simple games but continue to learn more to increase the depth and complexity of my projects.
                I really enjoy virtual and augmented reality technology and the endless opportunities for their
                application in entertainment and within the workforce. Starting from scratch and developing
                every piece of a project from start to finish is very motivating to me, despite the time
                commitment and work it takes. I’m extremely self-motivated and see no end in sight to the
                possibilities within this field. When I’m not working on a project, I enjoy reading, working out, or
                experimenting a little on my keyboard. If I’ve got some time to get away, my choice is always snowboarding.

                <i>XR Room Creator</i> is a personal project I created to explore the advancements in
                virtual and augmented reality technologies. Throughout the time I’ve spent working on this project I’ve learned
                about and implemented my own techniques for mesh generation, object occlusion in augmented reality,
                saving and loading data, as well as a bunch of VR and AR specific features. I plan to upload the files
                to a public project hosted on GitHub for anyone to download and learn from. The project is
                designed to allow users to recreate their physical environment in a virtual world.
                This allows players to interact with virtual items in their room, while also having the virtual items interact
                with their physical environment.
                I plan to continue working on this project until I have a full release ready for download.

                <i>Motel Detective</i> was a project I created for the 2022 VR Game Jam.
                The theme for this game jam was “One-Time Use” and I had 9 days to submit a game.
                I spent an entire day coming up with a concept for my submission and eventually
                stuck with one that I felt fit the theme the greatest. In <i>Motel Detective</i> you play as a detective
                with the goal to stop an untrustworthy citizen standing right outside the motel you are staying in.
                As the detective you have a rifle with you, but you only have one shot to take out the untrustworthy citizen.
                I made sure the game was based entirely around this concept of only being able to use your rifle once
                because it fit the theme for this game jam really well.

                <i>The VR Test</i> was a project I created to explore game development for virtual reality
                and document all of my findings. I spent over a year learning the similarities and differences between
                creating a VR application and creating a flatscreen application.
                I quickly realized VR was my bigger passion and continued to learn more about that field.

                The theme for this game jam was “Stronger Together” and I had one week to submit a game.
                For this game jam, I wrote down a list of different game concepts and picked the one I felt was the strongest.
                The main mechanic for my game was the ability for the player to collect cube companions and solve puzzles.
                The puzzles are unsolvable alone and focus on strength in numbers,
                so the player must collect as many cubes as possible to beat the game.

                I wasn’t able to work on my submission for three of the seven days, so I had to quickly come up with a game idea.
                I decided to focus my project around a dream because dreams aren’t reality.
                I couldn’t come up with a story and or level sequence in time, so I made the game endless
                with procedurally generated rooms that the player had to traverse through.

                Over the years I have learned all about 3D modeling and made many of my own models using Blender.
                I took an online course that taught me more about Blender and bringing my models over into Unity.
                The models I made had a very low polygon count when I first started using them in my own projects,
                but I eventually honed my skills and began making models that were up to my satisfaction.
                Here are a couple of renders I made when I first started learning.

                When working on my own projects I like to create my own music for them.
                I have been playing the piano for years now and usually write up a simple melody for my games.
                I like to make my music repetitive, simple, and catchy for game jam competitions
                because it adds a needed ambience to the simple environments within the game.
                Here are a few simple tunes that I created for game jams in the past.
